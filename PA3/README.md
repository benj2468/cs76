# CS76 21F - PA-3 Chess [Benjamin Cape]

# Running the Code

There are a few test files, each can be run with the command: `python3 *.py`

```
./test_chess.py
./test_psr.py
./testing.py
```

To test the chess, you can edit the file to pick which games you want to play as/pit two AIs against each other.
