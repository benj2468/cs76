# PA-5 [21F] [Benjamin Cape] [CNF]

To run the code, you can run the following commands from the root directory to run the respective puzzles:

```
make one

make all

make rows

make both

make rules

make 1

make 2

make bonus

make test
```

The last runs a test on an unsolvable CNF (meaning the CNF is not actually a true KB) and shows that the algorithm terminates.
